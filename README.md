# What Are Stock Photos?

Stock photos are photographs that are licensed for commercial purposes. Commonly, marketing agencies and people who need a photo for graphic design will use them to add personality and excitement to an image — without having to conduct a photoshoot of their own. They’re usually not tied to a specific place or time, for good reason. 
       

**“With stock photos, I keep my edits realistic, not over the top,”** stock photographer Nicole Glass explains the logic. **“You want to give other people the chance to customize a photo to their own needs.”**
       

Stock photography often refers to an industry more than an individual photograph, and many are surprised to learn that stock photography has been a business model for photographers since the 1920s.



## How does stock photography work?

When you’re working on a new project, sourcing a professional photographer might be beyond your budget. This is where using stock photos can be a great way to round out your work.

 

**_When you’re looking to drop in some high-quality photos, it helps to start with some knowledge of the different types of licenses available:_**

       

**Royalty-free images:** This type of license is usually how stock photography agencies sell photos. These royalty-free licenses give the buyer the rights to use the image in a certain number of ways a certain number of times. This way, the user of the photo pays for the photo once, because all of the dealmaking has been done for them in the background. 
**Rights managed images:** This is for images that are sold on a pay-to-use basis, and are often limited to a certain period of time or for a specific project. 
**Extended or enhanced licenses:** This type of license allows other liberties for the license, including allowances for resale and commercial uses. Many stock photo sites offer this as an option.
